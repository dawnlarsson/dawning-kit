/*
        Differential test for the assembly in library.c.

        Every routine in there replaced a C one that was known to work. This
        keeps that C, under another name, and checks the two answer the same
        thing for inputs chosen to land on the edges: nothing, one byte, either
        side of every size the assembly switches strategy at, and overlaps in
        both directions.

        It is built freestanding for each architecture and run under qemu, so
        an answer that is only right on the machine this was written on does
        not pass.

        Adding a routine means adding its reference and a case below. A
        reference is the C that used to be in library.c, copied verbatim: the
        point is to compare against what was already trusted, not against a
        second attempt at the same idea.
